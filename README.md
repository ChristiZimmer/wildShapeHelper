# Wild Shape Helper
A helper for D&amp;D 5e Druid wild shape

I do not own any of the contained beasts or descriptions. I used https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters%20List#content to get a compiled list of 5e beasts.
Habitat descriptions used are from https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Creatures_by_Environment or based on habitats of the real creatures

For example of beast file layout to add more or modify existing, please see defaultEntry.json.
